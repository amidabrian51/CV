**iOS and Web Developer**

**Profile**

Passionate about technology and software development. I completed Makers Academy, Europe's leading software developer bootcamp, and I am looking to forge in career in Web Development. Please see my [personal website](http://site-brian-patterson.strikingly.com).

**Skills**

**Development**

Before Makers my introduction to code was through the iPhone. Since 2012 I have contributed 5 apps to the app store. The process of creation and development felt empowering and self fulfilling. Eight years later I am looking to embark on a career in Software Development.

**Career and Achievements to date**

My MBA and my commercial experience over the past 34 years have taught me these key issues:

* Successfully managed estimates and invoicing for customer projects at Royal School of Needlework (2018-2020)
* Facilitated all executive board’s operations meetings as strategic portfolio officer at Kew Gardens (2018).
* Completed wide-ranging administration & customer service tasks as part of a small team at Danbury Mint (2017)
* Instrumental in setting up administrative and IT support for a £20 million David Lloyd Health Club (2003-16).
* Managed IT infrastructure; overseeing networks and setting up work stations, databases and software support
* Implemented a guide on how employees could use the app.

**Listening**

A key skill to any business decision is to listen to customers and your colleagues . This can shape your strategic and software decisions. As we have learnt, throughout Agile development process, the demands of the customer can change at any time. My role as an Administrator enable me to achieve this. In that I was handling queries form employees plus liaising with our Head Office.

**Analysis**

As part of my role as a administrator I was called upon to make analytical decisions. These involved:

* Analysis of membership trend within the Health Club. Added administrative support from startup to a multimillion pound health club which has 6500 members.
* Improved staff retention by 20% by including a self improvement employee scheme.
* Evaluate new revenue streams eg Golf membership.
* Implement employee initiatives from our Head Office.

**Learning**

As my family will testify this has been my dream for the last five years. Makers Academy is part of that journey. It all started with a small swimming app. Now I am learning about Web technologies. Every step of the way I am learning something new challenging myself to reach new goals and technologies. For me this is the most exciting part of the journey.

**Creativity**

One of reasons I chose this career path is so that it would play to my strengths. Being creative in solving business problems is an area that I thrive on.
